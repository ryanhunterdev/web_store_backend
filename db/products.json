This album was, quite literally, gifted to us as a thank you for housing the key members of the band while they were passing through Sydney, playing in different projects. The brainchild of Rory McPike (AKA Rings Around Saturn), Cactus Head stands alone in his already expansive catalogue of high-quality releases. Say ‘sayonara’ to modular bleeps and sub-bass tones… and whisper ‘konichi wa’ to salt-corroded guitar hooks, DMT-induced 80s ballads and drum machine-driven mid-fi boogie. Here at OTIS, James Pants is our Bruno Mars and Cactus Head is fast becoming our Ariana Grande xx",
